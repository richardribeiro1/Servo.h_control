# Servo.h_control
A easy way to control many servos using library &lt;Servo.h>

https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/servo/

The function is useful when you want to control de speed of movement using the <Servo.h> library
     
      Pros:
      - Total control of the movement speed and range.
      - Can read the actual position.
      
      Cons:
      - Limited number os servos.
      - Uses a lot of pins in the board.
      
 Depending of the aplication you can use the PCA9685 to control 16+ servos.For this case, check my github.
